# Project Proposal [___TEMPLATE___]

[___Any text in square brackets like this one should either be deleted or substituted with your responses!___]

The project proposal document (this document) should not be too long, around 1 page and not exceeding 2 pages.  Groups will get full credit on this assignment as long as you include all the requested information. ___Your responses should be in bold and italic.___ 

## Group members

1.  ***Abhishek Satpathy (cqa3ym)***

2.  ***Mark Do (mft6zc)***

3.  ***Guy Scafidi (tet8bx)***

[___Brief project description___]

Answer the following questions. (Repeat this information if you have already provided it above.)

1.  What dataset(s) will you use
    - [___The "PopCulture Characters Dataset" with labeled images of 1000 famous characters form [Kaggle](
www.kaggle.com/datasets/popculture/character-recognition)___]

2.  What algorithm(s) will you test
    - ***We will test the effects of different activation functions for MLP networks on error rate in penguin classification.***
      
3.  What hypothesis are you testing or what experiment are you
    performing
    - The experiment we will be performing will be testing different activation functions for a multi-layer perceptron classification on penguins.

4.  What code will use write yourself vs. what is already provided in a
    library that you will call
    - [___We will write code for custom preprocessing and UI, result analysis, and kNN___]
    - [___We will use scikit-learn for MLP and linear classification___]

## Roles
You should also have a rough outline of how you will divide the work
among the group members. This might look something like:

1.  [___Superman is in charge of coding, testing, and creating a
    visualization to explain algorithm A___]

2.  [___Micky is in charge of collecting data, writing the code to clean
    the data, and creating a visualization to give an overview of the
    data___]

3.  [___Harry is in charge of comparing the outputs from
    algorithm A and B and concisely contrasting the pros/cons of each
    algorithms___]
